# Understand the Basics
Before you dive into kga and other GitOps tools, you need to have a firm understanding of containers, Kubernetes, Git, GitOps and Kustomize.
If you are here you probably know all these tools, with (possibly) the exception of Kustomize.

Kustomize is an industry standard Kubernetes tool that is even built into kubectl!
However one of the caveats of the kubectl's Kustomize is that is pretty outdated.
Therefore we require you to download the latest Kustomize and have it available in your PATH.

We also recommend you to checkout [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/), this or a similar tool in necessary to practice "proper" GitOps.
